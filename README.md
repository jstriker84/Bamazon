# Bamazon

## Overview

In this project, I have created a storefront app using MySQL and node.js. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app will then prompt users with two messages. The first will ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy. The second message will ask how many units of the product they would like to buy. Once the customer has placed the order, the application will check if the store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request. If not, the app will log the phrase  Insufficient quantity!, and then prevent the order from going through. However, if the store does have enough of the product, it will fulfill the customer's order. Once the update goes through, it will show the customer the total cost of their purchase.

### It works!
